## Introduction: Why bother?

## Installation

You can download the official Git client at

  - https://git-scm.com/

If you happened to live in the 21st century, and not like command lines too much, *Sublime Merge* is a nice graphical front-end for git.

## Using git

![Magical incantations](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git.png)

There is already a lot of very good material online, much better than what I could write here. If you don't mind videos, these are a few good resources to learn the theory behind the Git tool.

If you're an impatient kid

  - `git init` creates a repository in your current working directory
  - `git add <file>` adds a file to the staging area
  - `git status` shows how things are going, READ WHAT IT SAYS!
  - `git commit` creates a snapshot of the files that you added to the staging area
  - `git remote -v` shows you the remotes you've configures
  - `git push` uploads your commits to the remote
  - And now you're probably lost, and have to look into the other resources below.
  - Be patient next time

If you want a very well structured explanation, watch the following 3 videos. Each is max. 30 minutes. You may want to try what you learned in each video before watching the next.

  - [Introduction to Git - Core Concepts](https://youtu.be/uR6G2v_WsRA)
  - [Introduction to Git - Branching and Merging](https://youtu.be/FyAAIHHClqI)
  - [Introduction to Git - Remotes](https://youtu.be/Gg4bLk8cGNo)

Note: if you learn everything from the videos above, you'll understand git better than most people.

If prefer an university lecture style, this recorded lecture from *The Missing Semester* at Cambridge University (ca. 1.30 hour) which is also good.
