# How to contribute to the project

*You may be interested in the [LaTeX Workshop](https://github.com/openhsr/LaTeX-Workshop) organized by OpenHSR.*

## I have found a typo / error! How can I fix it?

If you *do know how to use LaTeX and Git*, you can fork the repository, fix it, and open a pull request, or open an issue with a patch attached if the fix is short. Tip: You can create a patch by making a commit and then typing

```
$ git format-patch -1 HEAD
```

This will generate a file named something like `0001-The-commit-message.patch`, that can be attached in the issue or directly sent to us.

If you *do know how to use LaTeX* but not Git, you can

  - [Learn to use git](./tutorials/install-git.md) and do the above
  - Open an issue on Github describing how to fix it
  - Ask somebody that knows how to use Git to help you

If you *don't know how to use neither LaTeX nor Git*, the best course of action is to contact the original author and ask them to fix the problem. If the original author cannot fix the issue, then the next best step is to ask somebody from the community, we can find us around in the campus (well, maybe it is not as easy now because of COVID) or at fachschaft@elektrotechnik-hsr.ch .
